## iphone-finder

This little script will poll the Apple Store inventory endpoint and alert you (via command line bells) if any of the models you are interested in become available. You can find a list of all the iPhone models [here](http://leimobile.com/iphone-6-model-numbers/). It's not particularly robust, so check in from time to time to make sure it's still running.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```js
node iphone-finder.js zip-code poll-interval
```
